 * Abstraction of Citizen Digital Twin (CDT) expressed using main domain concept.

 * It wraps a state (i.e. current snapshot of citizen relevant information) and historical data (i.e. old information linked to a citizen)
 * A CDT could be observed by stakeholder that have permission to watch citizen updates.
 * each real citizen can create a physical link (i.e. a two-way persistent connection) in which it could update his digital state and being notified from
